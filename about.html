                                        <p>The origin of SWIT Research Group can be traced back to August 2007. It began with a small group of researchers whose purpose was that of designing a model of wealth (W) creation for emerging countries supported by innovation and technology (IT). This purpose was translated into a research line that defined the first steps of SWIT.</p>
                                        <p>In August 2011, the Research Group’s objective evolved and focused on solving one of the most significant problems of our times: <span class="bold">The social and environmental imbalance in developing and emerging economies, generated by the disproportionate growth and the industrialization caused by developed regions, due to their globalization strategies.</span></p>

                                        <p>The work of SWIT Research Group is aligned to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations. Specifically, the work of the group is aligned to SDG 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities; SDG 11, Resilient and Sustainable Cities and SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>
                                        <p><span class="bold">SDG 8:</span> SWIT Research Group’s work is aligned to the promotion of sustainable economic growth (SDG 8) through the offering of a robust framework, tools and methodologies for the development of entrepreneurship of non-usual businesses, mainly for communities of the base of the pyramid in developing countries. As a result of this entrepreneurial activity, new jobs are created to support the new generation of startups that are based on extended circular value systems. These novel businesses may be key for the sustainable recovery in the post-pandemic era.</p>
                                        <p><span class="bold">SDG 9:</span> The advances of SWIT Research Group helps “build resilient infrastructure” at the same time that fosters innovation and promotes “inclusive and sustainable industrialization” of developing regions, SDG 9. The group does this by decoupling economic growth from the degradation of natural resources, waste and residues production using a circular mechanism of transforming waste into wealth.</p>
                                        <p><span class="bold">SDG 10:</span> SWIT Research Group’s work is associated to the reduction of “inequality within and among countries” through the application of its frameworks, tools and methodology in inclusive, collaborative entrepreneurship and regional programs that align resulting benefits with a prosperous social development. The generation of sustainable wealth enabled by the work of the group directly aims to reduce the increasing social gap (SDG 10), quite usual in developing countries.</p>
                                        <p><span class="bold">SDG 11:</span> One of the applications of the frameworks, methodologies and tools developed by the SWIT Research Group, as it has been and continues to be the transformation of conventional linear cities into circular cities and communities to promote sustainability and resilience as SDG 11 states.</p>
                                        <p><span class="bold">SDG 12:</span> In line with the SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, the SWIT focuses on providing methodologies and enabling conditions for developing countries to create circular value systems able to reduce waste generation by an efficient use of natural resources and interlinking local stakeholders (i.e. natural ecosystem, communities, industry, government).</p>
